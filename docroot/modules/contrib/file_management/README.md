## Introduction
The [File Management](https://www.drupal.org/project/file_management) module
allows you to edit existing files or images directly from the files overview.

This is extremely helpful, especially if you are using the same file on
multiple different entities (e.g. with the help from the
[IMCE](https://www.drupal.org/project/imce) module). 

## Features
- Update files and images which are already in use by nodes, taxonomy terms,
paragraphs or simply any entity!
- Also supports updating **media** files!

## Usage / Configuration
1. Install the module as usual
2. Add a `Operations links` field to your files overview view **or** install
the `File Management View` submodule.  
The submodule disables the default files overview view and adds a custom one
with the operation links already added.
3. You can now view and edit files from the files overview view!
