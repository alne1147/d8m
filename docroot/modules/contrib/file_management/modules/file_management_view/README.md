# File Management View
The main module provides a `Operations links` field for your
files overview view.  
This is useful if you have customized your view with custom fields/filters etc.

However, if you don't have customized your files overview view, you can simply
enable this submodule.  
This submodule does the following:

1. Disables the existing files overview view
2. Adds a custom files overview view with the `Operations links` field already
added
3. Defines a local task so the view is accessible via tab
4. Defines a menu link so the view is accessible via the admin menu
